vsaa-server-nodejs
==================

Very Simple Application Analytics server made using Node.js, Restify and Passport.

Intented to run in conjuction with [vsaa](https://github.com/eimink/vsaa) application plugin.

Based on 
[vsaa-server-nodejs](https://github.com/eimink/vsaa-server-nodejs)

This project depends on several npm packages. Make sure you have npm packages restify, underscore, crypto, passport, sharedmemory and mysql/mongodb installed before trying to run it. Easiest way to take care of this on Linux and OS X is to run install.sh, which does the module installations for you.
